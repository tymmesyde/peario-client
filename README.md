[Peario](https://peario.xyz) helps you watch your streams from [Stremio](https://stremio.com) with your friends.

You must have Stremio installed and running to be able to create a room and join/invite your friends.

Peario uses a server to link users together, which you can find here on GitHub: [peario-server](https://github.com/tymmesyde/peario-server)
